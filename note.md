## Types

There are many types in solidity but the most importants are:

1. boolean => true or false
2. uint => unsigned integer => non-negative values
3. int => both positive and negative values
4. address
5. bytes
6. string

You can see the whote types in [here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.26/types.html)

## Variables

to define a variabe first you write the type of it, then the name of the variable and finally the value of it.

```bash
    bool hasFavouriteNumber = true;
    uint256 favouriteNumber = 123;
    string favouriteBook = "Lord of the rings";
    address address = 0x0A48b723D88874EC79a12d12e9745A65eB80dF65;
    
```
